                  Just before right now I was standing outside the door to the room of the studio. The <a href="#coords2" class="inLinks" >6th floor open studio</a> has been transformed from a common, unknown space to one of development, shenanigans and overall design tomfoolery.

                  Within these 4 walls lie a variety of emotions; an array of states, from general silliness to the development of critical design approaches and the expanse of the mind and the <em>synapses</em> within those links.

                <p>
                  I generally tend to associate studios with positive emotions and often look forward to classes and lessons. Come years later down the line room 648 will be just a speck of memory within the <em>synapses</em> in my mind.

              <p>
                The open studio is a sort of purgatory. A space for both making, concentration, as well as stupid shit. Acting as a bridge; an intermediary link between my <a href="#coords3" class="inLinks">home in Toronto</a> and the Studio itself. 
              </p>

              <p>
                I often find myself spending the most time on the 6th floor. It is certainly a curious thing to think about as I type this reflection upon a random lecture hall in a random building within the UofT campus during reading week. Why don’t I seek more unique spaces for work? Why don’t I work at a coffee shop? Why don’t I work at a library? Why don’t I literally seek anywhere else for work or study? Is it due to the collective and community-like nature of common designers alike? I don’t know, but I know that this place will become pivotal to the way I evolve as both a person and a designer.

                I was raised here, practically. Came here from <a>the homeland</a> in the middle of Grade 1. Overall I would rate this city a pretty stellar 7/10 probably, maybe pushing 8, maybe even 9 on a good day. (Although it rains a lot.)

                Not sure why my parents chose Vancouver to immigrate to and not Toronto or Edmonton or any other Canadian city. Although I’m quite thankful too since I don’t think I’m cut out for -30 degree winters in Edmonton.

                  I went to school quite a bits away from my house for a majority of my life. Starting from Grade 4 a 7:30 AM commute to school that started at 8:10AM everyday quickly became a common occurrence. I still remember the first time I went on this commute and holy shit it felt twice as long then it does now. I wonder if you really psychologically become used to a commute and time passes quicker the more you take said commute. Anyhow, this was a pretty random core memory of mine.

              <p>
                Delta was where my highschool was located, and unlike the <a href="#coords7" class="inLinks">glorious king city that I actually resided in</a>, full offensive, I mean it, this city was dead as hell. Delta was literally filled with 80% just 60+ retirees. The most exciting activity was either visiting an exceeding average mall or going to play golf. Neither of which, I’m afraid, I was rather fond of at the time. It didn’t even have a T&T and my friend’s parents would commonly commute to another city just to get goods. No costco either, I’m telling you I would not like to live here. A common running joke was that one of god’s greatest punishments would be to confine someone for life to this city. 
              </p>

              <p>
                Besides the city being shit, my high school, and middle school, and half of my elementary for that matter ( yes it was a co-ed K-12 private school ) was rather an enjoyable experience. Much like many other youths I would presume, the Kindergarten to Grade 6 experience was mostly smooth sailing until they start hitting you with the FSA (?) at Grade 7 then the shit picks up. Pretty much the same story here.

                My cohort was pretty small with a graduating class of around 50 people I believe? The dynamic of the school was different to some of my friends, everyone knew everyone although you didn’t have to be friends with everyone you basically knew to an extent every person’s personalities. I like to believe that because of this bullying was non-existent in my grade, at least to the extent of my knowledge. Besides the common stupid ass fight there wasn’t much drama in the grade. I remember someone got caught with weed in like the 9th grade, and besides that it was kinda dead, tea-wise.

              <p>
                Overall the high school experience was pretty enjoyable, but <a href="#coords2" class="inLinks">university</a> is astronomically better.

                Now I know that I have been glazing and hyping up this city for a while now and that is for good reason. This island city that may or may not sink due to global warming in some decades or having the “big one” hit the west coast, this island city sitting below sea level providing a dyke for a pretty scene and VERY vibey bike rides during the summer is where I grew up.

                Starting off my Canadian Career at an <a href="#coords8" class="inLinks">elementary school</a> in Richmond and in a Town House will always be a core memory for me. This was basically my intro to Canada, mixed in with the culture shock from moving from China. It certainly populates several synapses in my mind and will continue to do so.

              <p>
                Because my high school was based in Delta, I didn’t have many close friends that also lived in Richmond (All of the boys lived in other cities…) Due to this I spent most of my childhood chilling at home and brainlessly gaming away or reading. Which is crazy to think about since I was reading some pretty crazy shit back then. I think it was about halfway through Annihilation by Jeff VanderMeer, in like Grade 8. Now I barely read at all, and that is certainly something to ponder. When did I stop?

                A good way to describe Richmond would be to basically imagine Markham but smaller, and on an island. That is a pretty accurate representation to be honest. The now and there strip malls in Markham with storefronts that are 80% composed of Hanzi, at least 1 8-ball place, 1 claw machine place, and probably a shady reseller? Yeah that’s pretty much Richmond as well.

                Garden City Elementary is where I attended Grades 1-4 until I transferred to my high school. It's a pretty average elementary school. I remember vividly that they spiced up the playground after I left though, from rotting blue and yellow paint to a sleek, modern, red and black finish, and a new monkey bar too. I was hella pissed about it, and rightfully so, rock on 10yr old Daniel.

                Prince Edward Island is the first Canadian soil I’ve ever set these two feet on. Not sure why we needed to go all the way east and then west first, maybe my parents were getting a taste of which coast was optimal for immigration (a bit too east mind you) but I vaguely recall them telling me that it was for something to do with the immigration process itself and they’ve already settled on Vancouver.

              </p>

              <p>
                I have family relatives here, and I remember vividly chilling at my cousin’s place and him introducing me to some “three kingdom” type fighting game and 2K. I was baffled bro, totally engrossed in that shit. I blame him for any crippling video addiction, also I blame my dad cause he introduced me to Plants vs Zombies that was also a core memory.

                I remember in the summer you can just go onto the street and pull up to one of the many stalls outside and ask for something I believe was like lamb noodle soup? Not sure as to the specifics but with 5 RMB you could get a pretty nice and rather delicious bowl. I remember the plastic stools, and I remember how they would staple some sort of wrapping to their plastic tables too. Because chili oil would get everywhere and I remember the shopkeepers coming around and wiping down the tables and whatnot.

                I remember the fried tofu, which you would dip in some chili pepper powder and whatnot. I still remember the taste of the powder, and recently found them at T&T and I was actually ecstatic. I remember sitting around a circular grill with more plastic stools with my family in some random road-side area, with some more grills and seating around us. There weren’t many people there at the time.

                It is hot as hell here in the summer since it's located in a valley, and all of the heat gets trapped in it. 40+ degree summers were literally the norm, if you weren’t in an A/C’ed room at least every 30 minutes you might be going to the hospital with a heat stroke, and it was so hot you can literally SEE the lines. You know how in movies in the desert or hot as hell scenes they have that cliche wavy effect? Imagine that but in real life, with stagnant winds, it feels suffocating bro.

                I spent most of my time either doing shenanigans and being a kid at home or in the residential neighborhood, since I lived in an apartment, which was also part of a larger group of apartments. I would usually reach the community center in the middle to play ball with literally random kids (none of which i remember) of the neighborhood with some elderly chilling beside either chewing on some sunflower seeds or playing mahjong or the pond/lake thing in front of my building to catch tadpoles and whatnot.
